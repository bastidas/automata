"""
topology_changes.py - Stub for future topology modification functionality.

This module provides interfaces for adding/removing links and nodes in
mechanism topologies. This functionality is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

Future implementation roadmap:
    Phase 1: Implement validate_topology_change() with safety checks
    Phase 2: Implement RemoveLinkChange (simplest - just removes an edge)
    Phase 3: Implement AddLinkChange (adds edge, auto-computes distance)
    Phase 4: Implement RemoveNodeChange (complex - must rewire connections)
    Phase 5: Implement AddNodeChange (most complex - must ensure valid DOF)

Challenges to address:
    1. Validity constraints - Removing a node may break the kinematic chain
    2. DOF preservation - Mechanisms must maintain correct degrees of freedom
    3. Graph connectivity - Must ensure mechanism remains connected
    4. Role preservation - Cannot remove the crank or fixed pivots
