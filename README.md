# Acinonyx 🐆

A Python application for simulating and visualizing mechanical linkage systems - fast and agile like a cheetah.

This project provides tools for creating, simulating, and visualizing mechanical linkage systems with exceptional performance. It includes:

- **Mechanical Link Simulation**: Define and simulate multi-link mechanical systems using pylinkage
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate static plots and animations of linkage motion using a React frontend
- **REST API**: FastAPI backend for graph operations and trajectory computation

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- Node.js >= 18 (for frontend)
- Conda (recommended) or pip
- See `pyproject.toml` for complete dependency list

## Configuration

The application uses `configs/appconfig.py` for centralized configuration:

- **USER_DIR**: Location for saved graphs and user data (`user/` directory)
- **BACKEND_PORT**: `8021` - FastAPI backend server port
- **FRONTEND_PORT**: `5173` - Vite development server port
- **API URLs**: Automatically constructed from port configuration

All port settings are centralized in `appconfig.py` - modify this file if you need to change ports due to conflicts.

- Graphs are saved to `user/pygraphs/` directory (auto-created)
- Force graphs are saved to `user/force_graphs/` directory
- See API docs at `http://localhost:8021/docs` for detailed schemas

## Development

### Code Style

The project uses standard Python and TypeScript formatting:

```bash
# Format Python code
black backend/ configs/ link/ tests/

# Format TypeScript/React code
cd frontend
npm run format
```


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Module not found errors**
- Ensure your conda environment is activated:
  * for example if using pyenv `pyenv activate automata`
  * * for example if using anaconda `conda activate automata`
- Verify installation: `pip list | grep automata`

**2. Frontend not loading**
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be >= 18)
- Reinstall dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`

**3. Backend connection refused**
- Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8021/status`
- Check for port conflicts (default port is 8021, see `configs/appconfig.py`)
- Ensure CORS is properly configured

**4. Tests failing**
- Ensure pytest is installed: `pip install pytest pytest-cov`
- Check Python version: `python --version` (should be >= 3.11)

**5. Port conflicts**
- If ports 8021 or 5173 are already in use, edit `configs/appconfig.py` to change ports
- Restart both backend and frontend servers after changing ports

### Why Doesn't My Mechanism Work?

There are countless ways to create a poorly-formed mechanism that doesn't meet the requirements for trajectory calculation in this implementation. It's possible to create fully constrained systems—think of a rigid cube—that obviously can't be animated.

**Understanding Node Types**

First, note that there are three kinds of nodes:

- **Static** — A fixed anchor point that doesn't move. It serves as a ground reference for the mechanism. Press `W` to convert a node to Static.
- **Crank** — A node that rotates around a fixed point (its parent Static node) at a constant radius. The crank provides the input motion that drives the mechanism. Press `A` to convert a node to Crank.
- **Revolute** — A pivot joint whose position is determined by constraints from two parent nodes. Most nodes in a mechanism are Revolute joints. Press `Q` to convert a node to Revolute.

**The Crank Requirement**

In this implementation, there must be at least one Crank node, and that crank must be able to make a full revolution. It's *very easy* to accidentally make even the simplest system over-constrained by making a single link too long or too short! You can see a minimal working example in the Demo section by clicking "Four Bar." If you're having problems with your mechanism, try shortening or lengthening a link.

**Grashof's Law**

If you're wondering why your four-bar linkage won't complete a full rotation, consider **Grashof's Law**: For four-bar linkages, this law predicts whether continuous rotation is possible based on link lengths. Let *s* = shortest link, *l* = longest link, and *p*, *q* = the other two links. If *s* + *l* ≤ *p* + *q*, the linkage permits continuous rotation (crank-rocker or double-crank). Otherwise, it's a non-Grashof linkage limited to oscillation (double-rocker). Note: The current implementation doesn't support double-rocker oscillation.

**Under-Constrained Mechanisms**

Just as we can over-constrain and lock a mechanism, we can also under-constrain them. If you make a triangle of links, it's locked in shape and will compute correctly. However, if you make a square of links, it would collapse into a parallelogram since it has an extra degree of freedom. You need to fully constrain shapes by adding additional links. For example, if you add a square of links to a working mechanism, trajectory simulation will fail—to fix this, add a diagonal cross-link to triangulate and rigidify the square.

**Summary: Making Your Mechanisms Work**

- Mark appropriate nodes as Static, Crank, or Revolute
- Shorten or lengthen links as necessary to satisfy Grashof's Law
- Fully constrain open shapes by triangulating them (add diagonal links)
- Avoid dangling or hanging links that aren't part of a closed chain

## Why This Project?

### Background

A **mechanism** transforms input forces and movement into a desired set of output forces and movement. A **mechanical linkage** is an assembly of rigid bodies (links) connected by joints to manage forces and motion. When modeled as a network of rigid links and ideal joints, this is called a **kinematic chain**.

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: Also called mobility, DOF is the number of independent inputs needed to fully define a mechanism's configuration. The Grübler–Kutzbach criterion calculates this from the number of links, joints, and each joint's freedom.

**Planar Linkages**: A planar mechanism constrains all links to move within parallel planes. The simplest closed-chain planar linkage is the **four-bar linkage**—four rigid bodies connected in a loop by four one-degree-of-freedom joints (revolute/pin joints or prismatic/sliding joints).

**Grashof's Law**: For four-bar linkages, this law predicts whether continuous rotation is possible based on link lengths. Let *s* = shortest link, *l* = longest link, and *p*, *q* = the other two links. If *s* + *l* ≤ *p* + *q*, the linkage permits continuous rotation (crank-rocker or double-crank). Otherwise, it's a non-Grashof linkage limited to oscillation (double-rocker).

Key terminology for four-bar linkages:
- **Ground link**: Fixed in place relative to the viewer
- **Crank**: Connected to ground by a revolute joint; can complete full revolutions
- **Rocker**: Connected to ground by a revolute joint; limited rotation range
- **Slider**: Connected to ground by a prismatic joint
- **Coupler** (floating link): Connects two other links; traces the output path

More complex mechanisms are built by combining multiple linkages.

### The Problem

**Given a planar path (or set of paths), how do we construct a multi-link mechanism that closely traces those paths while satisfying design constraints?**

This is an inverse problem in mechanism synthesis. While several tools above address related problems, only SAM, LInK, and Four-bar-rs solve subsets of the path synthesis problem. Acinonyx aims to provide a flexible, open-source solution with support for multi-link mechanisms beyond simple four-bars.

### Technical Challenges

Path synthesis optimization is difficult because:

- **Non-convex search space**: The objective landscape has many local minima—gradient descent can get stuck far from the optimal solution
- **Mixed variables**: The problem involves both discrete choices (mechanism topology) and continuous parameters (link lengths, joint positions)
- **Phase invariance**: A mechanism may trace the correct path shape but at a different phase (starting point along the curve), leading to a key challenge:
  - Optimizer finds dimensions that produce the correct path shape
  - But the phase differs from the target → computed error remains high
  - Optimizer overcorrects by distorting the path to minimize phase error
  - Result: wrong dimensions, wrong path

Acinonyx addresses these challenges through phase-invariant distance metrics and global optimization strategies.
